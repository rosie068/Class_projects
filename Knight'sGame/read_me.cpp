Welcome to the Knight Tour! This is a game of courage and intelligence, in which
you-Joe Bruin- will need to save Josephine Bruin from falling into the lava to her
horrific death! There are volcanic rocks to aid you on your way to Josie, but my
advice is to have a plan in mind! There are, of course, some obstacles in your path:

    1. You will only be allowed to move like a knight in chess (2 horizontal and 1 vertical or vice versa)
    2. You cannot step onto a rock you have stepped on
    3. Stay clear from lava! If you slip into themâ€¦ It's best if we do not describe the consequences.

Go save your princess, warrior!
