1. The instance with 3 colors is NOT satisfiable with the output:
c Rsat version 3.01
c Random seed = 91648253
c Base unit clause learned: 0

c level 1
c Finished probing in 0.0000 s, 0 implications found using 1 levels

2. The instance is satisfiable with 4 colors with the output:
c Rsat version 3.01
c Random seed = 91648253
c Base unit clause learned: 0
c Probing 28/28 variables
c level 1

3. These results tell me that at least 4 nodes are interconnected such that they must be different colors. Therefore we need at least 4 colors to solve this problem. One solution is as follows, where R=red, G=green, B=blue, Y=yellow:
1-R
2-G
3-B
4-R
5-G
6-B
7-Y

4. The minimum number of colors to make the second problem satisfiable is 8. I started testing with 3 colors up until 7 and got the result
c Rsat version 3.01
c Random seed = 91648253
c Base unit clause learned: 0
c Probing 350/350 variables
c level 1
c Finished probing in 0.0000 s, 0 implications found using 1 levels
c Total implications found so far: 0/350

s UNSATISFIABLE
c CNF stats: (350 vars, 4985 clauses)

c Final decision lit size:350 (100.00 %)
c Final stack/save sizes: 20(5.71 %)/20(5.71 %)
c Final cdc size: 100 (28.57 %)
c Running time: 0.02000 seconds

Finally with 8 colors I got:
c Rsat version 3.01
c Random seed = 91648253
c Base unit clause learned: 0
c Probing 400/400 variables
c level 1
c Finished probing in 0.0000 s, 0 implications found using 1 levels
c Total implications found so far: 0/400
